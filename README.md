# Game Launch Argument Utility (GLAU)

GLAU is a no-nonsense Python tool that lets you launch old-school games (especially DVD or DRM-free ones) with custom command-line arguments. No launcher required.

It's great for running legacy .exe files with specific commands, skipping intros, setting memory pool sizes, or launching games exactly how you want.

## Features

- Launch any .exe file with custom command-line arguments
- Runs in an invisible CMD window
- Designed for games without traditional launchers
- Useful for modders, retro gamers, and power users

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows (tested on Windows 10 and 11)

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the script manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crabtech1/glau.git
cd glat
````

Or just download `Game Launch Argument Utility(GLAT)` and run it directly.

## Usage

Run the script from the terminal or double-click if Python is associated with .py files:

```bash
python Game Launch Argument Utility(GLAT).py
```

Then follow the prompts:

```
Insert full path to EXE: (game directory)
Insert launch arguments (if any): (arguments)
Launching the game...
```
